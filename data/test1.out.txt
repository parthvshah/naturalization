well you can never be quite one hundred percent (pause) sure but they gave me the option (pause) on the restart would have been hard to keep up
albon was already all over (pause) me before the safety car had happened and i was already out front
so if (uh) i (pause) stayed out front is cool again since i'm on the hard tire and i (pause) struggle with the heating and lost position
or (um) i would have ended up in the same position as him so (um) i pitted and it didn't work out
it was a great race (pause) i thoroughly enjoyed it a little (pause) bit upset in the end for (uh) of course (pause) i didn't want to never want to collide with anyone and of course (pause) i was taking risks today
i went on the inside of albon
(pause) i naturally take it on me (pause) i was coming from behind but yeah
he was doing a great job so apologies to him
but i gave it (pause) absolutely everything and more today i pushed so hard and i really didn't have a lot of pace
honestly i think we are going faster than we should have
(pause) i think the red bulls were the best and they truly deserved the win they did a better job

yeah but i had no (uh) yellow flag or anything on my dash so yeah
i saw the car but that's it
yeah i don't know it would be a bit weird i mean the second lap (pause) was good enough so
yeah i think we have (pause) a good race car we just have (pause) to see what we can do in the start
yeah better than expected i think the car was working really well and very pleased with that (uh)
we (uh) have a good race car as well so we (uh) just have to wait and see what's happening at the start
but i think then even let's say it doesn't work out at (pause) the start we still have an exciting race

yeah from my side i was overtaking in turn one (pause) which i enjoyed this overtake
and then in turn 3 i (um) had to close because i (um) was aware seb would try again and (uh) he did (uh) he went around (uh) the outside which there was little space (um) but i (um) left (uh) the space which (uh) he took and towards (uh) the end of (uh) the straight (uh) he started to squeeze me a little to (uh) the inside and we were very close
so everything happened very quick and as soon as he (uh) went to the inside we touched and then i had a puncture
not yet i spoke to mattia but that's it
i haven't seen seb yet but (pause) i'm pretty sure we are mature enough to put (pause) that behind us in the end we both feel extremely sorry for the team
(uh) this is the end result both of the cars unfinished and that is very disappointing
for (uh) the future we will put that behind and continue to work together

yeah it was fun obviously we like (pause) to fight for first and second but unfortunately today we were not (pause) quick enough and at the end yeah we had different strategies and i had newer tires and was able (pause) to pass him but like i said you (uh) know we like (pause) to battle you (uh) know and fight for first and second again (pause) hopefully soon
well unfortunately it's not a surprise in a way you know we were one minute behind the leaders in the first couple of races with some safety cars (uh) on (pause) on (pause) the race
so today we didn't have (pause) any safety car this one minute was one minute and a half and unfortunately we are in a (pause) position comparable to australia or malaysia so we didn't close that gap and that was our intention so we need to do an extra
we need to close it in the next couple of days
well i think (um) that we need (uh) to work better and have a better car in ferrari and we have the potential we have the talented people so we need (uh) to put everything together
it's going to be tough it's going to be tough you know
we are too far behind not (pause) for ferrari (pause) for everyone to compete with mercedes but is few races of the championship so our work (pause) is to make things not that easy (pause) for mercedes
when they have big gap they don't stress (uh) the mechanical side and everything so we can do better

yeah i mean i'm going (uh) to be really greedy and say one more position would have been perfect
(uh) i actually talked a little bit about the podium you know yesterday afternoon and (uh) i knew we weren't (pause) that far from it so yeah one more position we would have got it today
but i am very happy with fourth obviously and just the pace (pause) we (pause) had and the last stint once we (pause) had that gap over nico and i think you know albon behind him we could afford to play it (uh) cool and i'm thinking even then the pace (pause) was really (um) strong
so (um) happy to get a result for obviously myself but the team and to do it here in (pause) monza (pause) it's a statement you know i think for renault especially the guys wary with (pause) the power unit they should be very happy (uh) because to come here on a power circuit and get our best result of the season (pause) it's a big turnaround for the last few years
you know they always copped a lot of grief on power circuits so they made (pause) a big step this year so i'm happy
yeah it's (pause) completely different circuit but street circuits is another thing i enjoy and singapore's (uh) a great venue so i'm excited for that
yeah i had pizza every night this week so i don't know if (uh) i'll find pizza everywhere in singapore but the italian diet works here so (uh) i'll try a singapore diet next week and maybe (um) that gives me a bit of extra (pause) fuel

so this is something that we've been working on for a while
(pause) we kind of had this idea of doing our own place and you know (um) thankfully from the efforts of maddy and jimmy t all these great same (pause) guys that were involved with the new record of course and all the touring that (pause) we did that (pause) we do
they made (pause) this amazing place so (pause) this is just yeah one of the very cool features of it
not too long actually it's all new
so (pause) this facility is after the fact actually for this record we went away
that inside shot (uh) if there is any people i want to visit in new york this was (pause) at this unbelievable mining cavern in really upstate new york
it looked like we were on (pause) the surface of another planet like insane so that was cool
you know on the record (pause) we have room 137 which is a crazy sort of math physics science thing going on

one of (pause) the great things about washington dc is first of (pause) all there is a lot of (pause) musical diversity right so from different neighbourhoods that (uh) sort of (pause) represent different (pause) cultures to the different styles and genres of (pause) music you had everything
there was kind of a southern rock influence you had bands like remember (pause) the railroad ducks
but then you had this really (pause) influential (pause) and important punk rock scene here (pause) and then you also had go-go music which is a specific type of funk that really (pause) is only in washington dc>
so (um) there was something and that it was a small community of musicians that i think we're all doing it just for the sake of playing (pause) music
yeah i mean it really did you know there was (uh) a dc sound (pause) and that series had (uh) a lot to do with how (pause) the environment (pause) the atmosphere of (pause) the place that you're making music influences (pause) the sound of music
(pause) so we went to eight different cities and you know there was a time when everything wasn't (pause) so interconnected that places really did have (pause) a regional identity

i'm yet to put it into (pause) something quite as succinct as that (pause) but perhaps in the next hour or so we can come up with a perfect line
i've lost something that i had back then
well i think i can't remember having any ideas before the piano arrived in my spare room might have (um) a little studio
this place we recorded some of the record yeah but before that i've (pause) been working on it and yeah the guitar it seemed to lost its ability to give me ideas (pause) i think
(pause) i sat with (um) the guitar (pause) i and suspicious of where it was going to go you know (pause) i think (pause) i had a pretty good idea of what (um) the outcome might be which was completely contrary to how (pause) i felt when (pause) i sat at this (um) piano and suddenly imagination was ignited once (pause) more
well i had lessons a little bit as an eight year old kid not for very long i never got much further than ode to joy i don't think but it gave me (uh) you know it was the first (pause) time i've done anything with a musical instrument
i (uh) remember few (pause) years after that when i (uh) got into playing guitars as a teenager i (uh) was a lot more excited about that than i (uh) had been about the piano

mean like (uh) not intentionally but i started recording it here like (uh) i was renting nearby
the more i kind of (uh) started just making little demos and tunes and stuff the more i like (pause) got into the idea of (uh) it being my la album
well i still do believe that at the end of the day (uh) geography shouldn't have anything to do with it
i have (uh) never been consciously aware of it you know like so much of the music i started making i made it in (um) my bedroom in a really dirty (pause) shared house in a very unglamorous part of wi
when we actually started recording the (pause) album we had this beautiful place when we like rented this kind of beach shack match (uh) and that's the (pause) only thing i asked for in the (pause) budget though
sometimes yeah it's a range like sometimes that's something i've always been proud about or like that i've had a sense of pride about you know is like sometimes i'll (um) just think of a song when it is fully formed (pause) in my (pause) mind
i think it (um) was something i was attracted to because back then i had even (pause) less of an idea of what i'm doing now i like to think i've never really had much of an idea of what i'm doing because that's i think part of (um) the essence of it (um)

i was (uh) in the hospital all (pause) last year not to just dive right into it but i wrote the album in the hospital and a lot of good came out of it i (uh) got another shot at life and that's what created this album
man but i'm (uh) fully back i'm (uh) so far back i'm (uh) coming for everybody
mike's the first (pause) person to (uh) give me a shot really like (uh) he just heard my song writing (uh) and i mean besides neo (uh) and compound shout out to (uh) everybody over there but after that he was the first (pause) person to (uh) be like (uh) as an artist i want to (uh) develop you kinda thing (uh) and then when he realized he couldn't be developing me (pause) because i was just developing myself we kind of just parted ways for a minute
so a year ago like exactly a year ago we got a cab in for two weeks to (pause) the mansion for (pause) the album
(um) yeah so the tortoise is (pause) officially sold out and we're not talking about merchandise that's why i called it digital drug lord because i'm literally just like i don't know thank god i'm not on a label
