well the very first thing is the social isolation
so the number of contacts oustide your household is minimised and washing your hands distancing yourself as much as possible
we need to start looking at what (uh) activities (uh) we want to open back (pause) up
it's not likely we're going to partition the country into separate pieces because (pause) of things like food and electricity
there are essential functions where we still want (pause) people to be connected
so it'll help everyone get out of this more quickly (uh) and reduce the deaths and reduce the economic reduction if (uh) we implement these strong social isolation measures on a country wide basis
i think that the pressure (uh) by fellow governers the executive branch the experts should (uh) be very strong so that all fifty governers are seen that they (pause) need to do this or (pause) that there is a federal order about the social isolation

i used to stay at work (pause) till eleven or twelve and then go home and read for a while
i only (pause) let them schedule meeting on saturday generally
i spend a week in a year where i just (uh) go off and read people's phd theses and new things (uh) that are (pause) going on in the field
you have to understand that when you spend your time thinking intensively about a field from a very young age which in my case i was 13 or 14 when i started to get involved
thats where you can do great things because your mind has really gotten into it (pause)
you understand it
as a percentage of my assets you know 99 percent of my assets are the stocks that i own in my company
i've got a house on the lake

when i was in my early 20s i lost both my parents which i must admit seems a bit careless of me now
i learned the crude tools of survival
and the framework of life was (pause) a simple one
i thought you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do
i thought celiac was a vegetable and vegan of course was mr spock's lost comrade in star trek
you married the first girl that you dated and you were a techie if you could fix the carburetor in your car
i really thought that gay was a sophisticated english word for happy
we relied on systems created through the toils and sacrifices of generations (pause) before to protect us

the situation was so my father used to do online (uh) share (uh) trading and that was something that became (pause) quite (pause) a big thing back (pause) then
the business (um) side of things wasn't going (pause) well for my brother the house was on rent
then his online (uh) share (uh) trading account suddenly crashed
so one transaction went really bad (um) and all the transactions he had done before (pause) that and whatever he had accumulated went down
so he really like the amount of stress it brought onto him (pause) mentally was huge
so he had a stroke he had a clot form in his brain
i didn't know it because (pause) i was playing my first season and i was at practice

i was in college and i was going to be a teacher all the way up until the end
i went to brown university that had took me in midyear i had to go to school (pause) in january

out (uh) of sheer laziness after my friends graduated in may i thought well i'm just gonna be an english teacher so let's find a place that transfers cerdits back (uh)
and there was a theatre school (pause) and it completely changed my life

i remember growing up he was the one (pause) who revolutionised this sport in this country just purely because of the way he went on about things
you'll always have (pause) someone who will come and change the sport
so if you talk about basketball you talk about jordan the way he you know just changed the whole outlook of the game and unlocked new abilities for people to believe in and that's exactly what he did
before he came (uh) in people didn't believe that these things (uh) could be done but (pause) then he led the way and made people believe that these things can be done
so thats the funny thing (uh) you realise that now although in terms of skill in terms of innovation in the sport a lot of that is happening but (uh) i think my opportunity i've been presented with is to motivate people (pause) in another manner which is improving the culture of cricket and the way cricketers should aspire to play for the country
in order to keep the standard of the sport going in the country and globally everyone needs to take responsibility

you never know what your life is (pause) going to be

i think one of the most important lessons learned just (uh) based (uh) on how (pause) people (pause) have reacted to the music and how it's felt to make the music it's just kind of listen to my instincts a little more when (pause) it comes to things (pause)
i think i have a pretty good idea of what i want to (uh) sound like and say to people (uh)
sometimes i can be persuaded to let other voices get in my head
his has been kind of the like (um) catalyst moment (pause) for me where i'm like oh maybe i should (pause) be giving these chances to myself instead of everybody else
that works for personally and also music

i don't even know how to explain what to have girlfriends like (um) that (pause)
they are your sisters and and your mothers and your mentors

they are fantastic and they're fun and they're crazy (pause)

that was the most devastating part of the whole trial for me
i wake up in the middle of the night (pause)
i am so conflicted because of that blood evidence
it's very (um) difficult (pause) for me
if (um) you can imagine two (uh) men who have known (pause) oj i knew him twenty five years and (pause) ac grew up with him knows him much better than i
when we would (uh) talk about this blood evidence we would go all over the board we would go from innocence and list all the reasons why then we would say well how (uh) did the blood get here and maybe he did
it was so heart wrenching
i do (um) believe some individuals did something that (pause) was not normal
