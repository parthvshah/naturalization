Well, you can never be quite one hundred percent sure but (um) they gave me the option (pause) (uh) on the restart would have been hard to keep up.
Albon was already all over me (um) before the safety car had happened and I was already out front. 
So (pause) if I stayed out, front is cool again since I'm on the hard tire and (uh) I struggle with the (pause) heating and lost position.
Or (pause) I would have ended up in the same position as him so I (um) pitted and (uh) it didn't work out.
It was a great race (uh) I thoroughly enjoyed it (um) a little bit upset in the end for (pause) (um) of course I didn't want to (uh) never want to collide with anyone and (uh) of course I was taking risks today.
I went on the inside of Albon. 
I naturally take it on me, I was coming from behind but (um) yeah.
He was doing a great job (pause) so apologies to him.
But (um) I gave it absolutely everything and more today, I pushed so hard and (pause) I really didn't have a lot of pace. 
Honestly, I think (pause) we are going faster than we should have.
I think (um) the Red Bulls were the best and they truly deserved the win, they did a better job.

Yeah but I had no yellow flag (um) or anything on my dash so (pause) yeah.
I saw the car but that's it. 
Yeah I don't know it would be a bit weird (pause) I mean the second lap was good enough so.
(um) Yeah I think (um) we have a good race car we just have to see what we can do in the start.
Yeah better than expected, I think the car was working really well and (um) very pleased with that.
We have a good race car as well so we just have to wait and see what's happening at the start.
But I think then even (um) let's say it doesn't work out at the start we still have an exciting race.

Yeah, from my side I was (uh) overtaking in turn one which (uh) I enjoyed this overtake. 
And then in turn 3 I had to close because I was aware Seb would try again and (uh) he did, he went around the outside (pause) which there was little space but I left the space which he took and (uh) towards the end of the straight he started to squeeze me a little to the (uh) inside and we were very close.
So everything happened very quick and as soon as he went to the inside we touched and then I had a puncture. 
Not yet, I spoke to Mattia but (uh) that's it. 
I haven't seen Seb yet but I'm pretty sure we are mature enough to put that behind us (uh) in the end we both feel extremely sorry for the team.
This is the end result (um) both of the cars unfinished and that is very disappointing.
For the future we will put that behind and (uh) continue to work together.

Yeah, it was fun obviously, we like to fight for first and second but (uh) unfortunately today we were not quick enough and at the end (uh) yeah we had different strategies and (uh) I had newer tires and was able to pass him but (pause) like I said, you know we like to battle you know and fight for first and second again, hopefully soon.
Well (uh) unfortunately (pause) it's not a surprise in a way you know we were one minute behind the leaders in the first couple of races with some safety cars on (uh) on the race.
So today we didn't have any safety car this one minute was one minute and a half and (uh) unfortunately we are in a position (um) comparable to Australia or Malaysia so we didn't (um) close that gap and that was our intention (pause) so we need to (pause) do an extra.
We need to close it in the next couple of days.
Well (pause) I think that we need to work better and have a better car in Ferrari and (uh) we have the potential, we have the (pause) talented people so (pause) we need to put everything together.
It's going to be tough, it's going to be tough, you know. 
We are too far behind, not for Ferrari for everyone to compete with Mercedes but (pause) is few races of the championship so our work is to make things not that easy for Mercedes.
When they have big gap (uh) they don't stress the mechanical side and everything so (um) we can do better.

Yeah, I mean (pause) I'm going to be really greedy and say one more position would have been perfect.
(uh) I actually talked a little bit about the podium you know, yesterday afternoon and I knew we weren't that far from it so (uh) yeah, one more position we would have got it today.
But I am very happy with fourth obviously and (pause) just the pace we had and (pause) the last stint once we had that gap (uh) over Nico and I think, you know, Albon behind him we (uh) could afford to play it cool and (uh) I'm thinking even then the pace was really strong.
So happy to get a result for (um) obviously myself but the team and (uh) to do it here in Monza (pause) it's a statement, you know, I think for Renault, especially the guys wary with the power unit, they should be very happy because to come here on a power circuit and get our best result of the season, it's a big turnaround for (pause) the last few years.
You know they (pause) always copped a lot of grief on power circuits so they made a big step this year so I'm happy. 
Yeah, It's (uh) completely different circuit but (uh) street circuits is another thing I enjoy and (uh) Singapore's a great venue so (um) I'm excited for that. 
(um) Yeah, I had pizza every night this week (um) so I don't know if I'll find pizza everywhere in Singapore but the Italian diet works here so I'll try a Singapore diet (uh) next week and maybe that gives me a bit of extra fuel.

So this is something that (uh) we've been working on for a while.
We kind of had this idea of doing our own (pause) place and (uh) you know thankfully from the efforts of Maddy and Jimmy T, all these great same guys that were involved with the new record of course and all the touring that we did (uh) that we do.
They made this amazing place (pause) so this is just yeah one of the very cool (pause) features of it.
Not too long actually (pause) it's all new. 
So this facility is (uh) after the fact (um) actually for this record (uh) we went away.
That inside shot if (uh) there is any people I want to visit in New York, this was at this unbelievable mining (pause) cavern in really upstate New York.
It looked like we were on the surface of another planet like insane (pause) so that was cool.
You know on the record we have (uh) room 137 which is a crazy (pause) sort of (uh) math physics science thing going on.

One of the great things about (uh) Washington DC is first of all there is a lot of musical diversity (pause) right so from (pause) different neighbourhoods that sort of represent different cultures (um) to the different styles and genres of music, you had everything.
There was kind of a Southern rock influence you had (um) bands like remember the Railroad Ducks.
But then you had this really influential and important punk rock scene here and then you also had go-go music (pause) which is a (um) specific type of funk that really is only in Washington DC>
So there was (pause) something and that it was a small community of musicians that I think we're all doing it just for the sake of playing music.
Yeah I mean (uh) it really did you know there was a DC sound and that series had a lot to do with (pause) how (pause) the environment, the atmosphere of the (pause) place that you're making music influences the sound of music.
So we went to eight different cities and (pause) you know there was a time when everything wasn't so interconnected that places really did have a regional identity.

I'm yet to (uh) (pause) put it into something quite as succinct as that (pause) but perhaps in the next (uh) hour or so we can come up with a perfect line.
I've lost something that I had back then.
Well I think (pause) I can't remember having any ideas (pause) before the piano arrived (um) in my spare room might have a little studio.
This place (pause) we recorded some of the record yeah but before that I've been working on it (uh) and yeah the guitar it seemed to (um) lost its ability to give me ideas I think.
I sat with the guitar I (um) and suspicious of where it was going to go you know I think I had a pretty good idea of what the outcome might be which was (pause) completely contrary to how I felt when I sat at this piano and suddenly imagination was ignited once more.
Well I had lessons (uh) a little bit as an eight year old kid (pause) not for very long, I never got much further than Ode To Joy, I don't think but (um) (pause) it gave me, you know, it was the first time I've done anything with a musical instrument.
I remember few years after that when I got into (pause) playing guitars as a teenager (pause) I was a lot more excited about that than I had been about the piano.

Mean like not intentionally (pause) but I started recording it here like I was renting nearby.
The more I kind of started just making little (pause) demos and (pause) tunes and stuff the more I like got into the idea of it being my LA album.
Well I (uh) still do believe that at the end of the day geography shouldn't have anything to do with it. 
I have (uh) never been consciously aware of it, you know like so much of the music I started making (pause) I made it in my bedroom in a really dirty shared house in a very unglamorous part of (uh) WI.
When we actually started recording the album we had this beautiful place, when we like rented this kind of beach (pause) shack match and (um) that's the only thing I asked for in the budget though.
Sometimes (pause) yeah it's a range like sometimes (uh) that's something I've always been proud about or like that I've had a sense of pride about you know is like (pause) sometimes I'll just think of a song when it is fully formed in my mind.
I think it was something I was attracted to (pause) because back then I had even less of an idea of what I'm doing now (uh) I like to think I've never really had much of an idea of what I'm doing because that's I think part of the (pause) essence of it.

I was in the hospital all last year (um) not to just dive right into it but (um) I wrote the album in the hospital and (pause) a lot of good came out of it, I got another shot at life and (pause) that's what created this album.
(um) Man but I'm fully back (pause) I'm so far back (pause) I'm coming for everybody.
Mike's the first person to give me a shot really like he just heard my song writing and (um) I mean besides Neo and Compound, shout out to everybody over there but (pause) after that (pause) he was the first person to be like (pause) as an artist I want to develop you kinda thing and (uh) then when he realized he couldn't be developing me because I was just developing myself, we kind of just parted ways for a minute.
So a year ago (pause) like exactly a year ago we got a cab in for two weeks to the mansion for the album.
(um) yeah so the tortoise is officially sold out (um) and we're not talking about merchandise, that's why I called it digital drug lord because I'm literally just like (um) (pause) I don't know, thank God I'm not on a label.
